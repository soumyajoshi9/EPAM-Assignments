Problem 1: Tree of Trusted Servers
A multinational organization maintains its internal communication infrastructure in the form of a tree, where each server is represented by a node, and each communication link is represented by an edge. The root server (Server 1) is the central authentication server. Every server stores a unique security key represented by an integer. During periodic audits, the organization wants to verify whether the communication path between the root server and every other server satisfies a security policy.

A server is considered trusted if the XOR of all security keys on the path from the root server to that server is greater than or equal to a given threshold K. Your task is to determine how many servers in the network are trusted. The root server is also included in the evaluation.
Input Format
First line: N K
Second line: N integers (security keys)
Next N-1 lines: u v (tree edges)
Output Format
Print the number of trusted servers.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ Key ≤ 10^9
Input graph is a tree

Explanation
Compute the XOR value along the path from the root (Server 1) to every server. Count the servers whose path XOR is at least K.
